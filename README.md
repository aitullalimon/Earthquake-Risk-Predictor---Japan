# Earthquake Risk Predictor for Japanese Prefectures

A bilingual web-based system designed to predict earthquake risk across Japan using geospatial data and a trained machine learning model. Built with R (Random Forest + Plumber API) and a modern JavaScript frontend with real-time visualizations.

## 🌟 Features

- 🗾 **Prefecture Selection or Manual Coordinates**: Predict earthquake risk by choosing a Japanese prefecture or inputting coordinates manually.
- ⚠️ **Real-Time Risk Prediction**: Predictions powered by a Random Forest model served via a live R Plumber API.
- 🌐 **Bilingual Support**: Interface toggles between English and Japanese.
- 🗺 **Interactive Earthquake Map**: Leaflet map displaying real-time seismic events from USGS.
- 📊 **Visual Risk Insights**: Lollipop-style magnitude chart powered by Chart.js.
- ❓ **Localized Help Modal**: In-app guide with map illustration and step-by-step instructions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-risk-predictor.git
cd earthquake-risk-predictor
```

### 2. Launch Backend (R Plumber)
Ensure you have `rf_model_final.rds` (trained model) in your working directory.
```r
library(plumber)
pr <- plumb("api.R")
pr$run(port = 26025)
```

### 3. Launch Frontend
Open `index.html` in your browser. You can use VS Code Live Server or any static server.
